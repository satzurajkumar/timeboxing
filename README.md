  - Explore transfer learning for NLP and Vision: 3 hours (Hugging Face, TensorFlow Hub).
  - **Mini-Project**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT for text classification or ResNet for image classification). Timebox: 6 hours.
- **Resources**: fast.ai (free), Hugging Face, TensorFlow/PyTorch docs.
- **Outcome**: Proficiency in deep learning frameworks and transfer learning.

## Week 9-10: Semantic Search System

- **Portfolio**: Showcase projects on your portfolio site using GitHub pages and use social media platforms to funnel to your portfolio. Share demo videos to attract clients.

## Tips to Stay on Track

- **Timebox Daily**: Use a timer (e.g., Pomodoro, 25 min work/5 min break) to stay focused.
- **Avoid Tangents**: Log non-essential ideas (e.g., “Try a new library”) in a “parking lot” list.
- **Review Weekly**: Check progress against this plan every Sunday. Adjust if needed.
- **Ask for Help**: If stuck, share details with me, and I’ll provide code snippets or resources.
